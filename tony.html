<h1>My Story</h1>

<h1>I was born  at the time of second world war in Abuelmatamier on September 25 in the year 1940,but my father registered me on the 1st of January 1941, this is because he wanted me to   attend school, at younger age.

<h1>Second World War</h1>

 During the Second world war it  was recommended to paint all widow glass with blue paint , so that when airplanes appears in the sky cannot recognize  our homes ,a loud horns warns us to shut down windows and put down any light  .At that time there was no electricity  lamps works with gasoline was all what we had, these lamps had cloth filament when ignited absorbs gasoline and give flame ,that lights up and black smoke was accompanied with the light ,which was controlled by simple gear that  moves the band up and down. A special glass cover surrounds this flame makes light more bright and reduces carbon emission as shown in photo</h1>

<h1>Cholera Pandemic</h1>

<h1>Military troops were controlling the villages having infections; nobody can enter or leave this village. Any infected person remains under detention till cured, his clothes must be burned.</h1>

<h1>My first education</h1>

<h1>at that time there was no schools in this small town, so my father let me attended in a Muslim mosque, to teach me the Arabic alphabet, this was the only available schooling, then came a jealous Coptic man called Eskander Awadall opened a school in the church where I attended couple of months, then a private school was opened called Elzamy school which means obligation school. Where I attended a couple of weeks. At last the government opened the first official school where was my real education started. It was a good opportunity for my sister Suzan who was five years older than me to attend with me this school.</h1>
